## How to Run

To download all pdfs of states into the `pdf` directory, run (might need to install some python dependencies):

    python dataloader.py

Check the `logs` to see if there are any `MISSING` pdfs, which indicate a state pdf has not been downloaded for some reason.

Note: This project will work only on Windows.
