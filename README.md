## How to Run

To download all pdfs of states from [here](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/covid-19-relief-funds-guidance-and-resources/state-recovery-plans) into the `pdf` directory, run (might need to install some python dependencies):

    python dataloader.py

Check the console or the `logs` to see if there are any `MISSING` pdfs, and add those manually from [here](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/covid-19-relief-funds-guidance-and-resources/state-recovery-plans).

Note: This project will work only on Windows.
